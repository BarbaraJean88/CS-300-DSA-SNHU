# CS-300-DSA-SNHU
CS-300- Analysis and Design Course at SNHU


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

I was tasked with designing a program that prints course information including prerequisites for a Computer Science program. The first task in solving this problem was to choose one of the three data structures discussed in this course (i.e. a Binary Search Tree, Vector Sorting, or Hashtable). The problem to be solved for this project was to write code that could open and read course data for the computer science program at ABCU. It was also a requirement that it could load the file data into the data structure of my choosing in this case Vector Sorting, and generate a list of all courses and prerequisites in alphanumeric order. Lastly, the program I was tasked with creating had to sort, print, and display the list of all the courses in alpha-numerical order from the lowest to the highest. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In my opinion, vector sorting is a data structure that is appropriate for many applications because it allows for effective scanning algorithms. It is necessary to design effective algorithms using suitable data structures in order to build secure programs that offer code abstraction and reusability. By using the right data structures, software developers can save time. By creating vector sorting tools, for example, mistakes might be identified more accurately. When extracting, processing, and storing data, programmers can handle vast quantities of information.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While working on my project, I encountered several roadblocks. Sometimes defining certain functions on certain lines became challenging, which resulted in errors in my code. To overcome these problems, I created pseudocodes before making the project. By identifying my strengths and weaknesses, my instructor helped me overcome roadblocks because it provided a systematic method for designing codes. Throughout the course and during the project, the course materials and book lessons have been invaluable.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

During this project, I gained a better understanding of how to design efficient code for applications through the work I did on it. This course and the project have been the most fascinating thing I have discovered since I began my computer science program, in my opinion. Coding and programming knowledge and critical thinking and analysis skills have improved. It was the first time I used the correct methods, classes, and variables while coding. I was able to use loops correctly on the right line, which was previously difficult for me.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In this project, I implemented Object-Oriented Programming, which makes code reusable, maintainable, readable, flexible, and adaptable. It won't be possible for me to go into greater depth since I am not an expert in writing programs, however, I will relate my own experience as a beginner. Since data structures offer a way for me to manage, organize, and store data efficiently, I realized that they were very helpful throughout my project. My project focused on loading and reading file data efficiently as well as storing, retrieving, printing, and retaining user data while enabling other software developers to reuse the code.
